## Description
The goal of this project was to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL. This project allowed me to work with langauges that I am familiar with and unfamiliar with to create an application that would allow a company to update employee data from the command line side of things in a simple and effective way.
## Installation
Pull the git repository onto your computer. And then run npm i to install of the necessary packages for running the program.
## Usage
CD into the main project folder. Then CD into the DB folder. From there, run mysql -u root -p (your password). This will open mysql in the command line. Then run SOURCE schemal.sql to create the database. Then run SORUCE seeds.sql to add the pre-added data to your table. Type quit in the command line to quit out of mysql. Then type the command npm start. That will bring up the application into the command line for your use.
